Do NOT delete this folder, or the time*.txt files.
They are critical to the current and future incremental backups.

It is possible to delete some incremental backups, but this is NOT
recommended.  Should you wish to attempt this, care should be taken in
editing the time_before.txt tracking file to "point" to the preceding
incremental backing you wish to continue the backup from.
PROCEED WITH CAUTION.

Should you wish to 'start over' from zero backups, simply delete
both time*.txt files.
