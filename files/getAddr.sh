# Function addrExists()
#   Tests whether the host address (argument 1) received is reachable (pings succesfully) or not, 
#      i.e. if the IP address or domain name exists.
#   @param:       expects a single argument passed at command line ($1)
#   @returns:     exits with 0 (true) if address exists, 1 (false) otherwise

  # ping the address to see if it exists on LAN/WAN
  # (note: redirect both stdout & stderr to null device to discard output, but retain whether command (ping) was succesful or not. 
  #        Required to discard output so that final [echo "$result"] is the only output "seen" by the caller)

#       Checks if either arg1 or arg2 is reachable (ping'able) address, echoes to stdOut the first one that is.
